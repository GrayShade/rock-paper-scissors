# rock-paper-scissors

This project was created using HTML, CSS & vanilla JS.<br />
DOM manipulation & event handling was used to dynamically handle nodes & their properties.<br />
FlexBox was used as layout model.\
Tried to implement minimalist design architecture here & quite liked it. So didn't try to go fancy.<br />
Future work may include hover effects as well as sounds on button clicks.
