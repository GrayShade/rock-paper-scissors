# rock-paper-scissors

This project was created using HTML, CSS & vanilla JS.
DOM manipulation & event handling was used to dynamically handle nodes & their properties.
FlexBox was used as layout model.
Tried to implement minimalist design architecture here & quite liked it. So didn't try to go fancy.
Future work may include hover effects as well as sounds on button clicks.
